Structs
 - In some cases, there is no need for defining a fully structured class. Sometimes we need just a group of attribute bundled together.
Ruby provides a shortcut to bundle a number of attributes together called a Struct.
=end

Point = Struct.new(:x,:y)

origin = Point.new(0,0)
dest = Point.new(12,40)

puts dest.y


=begin
OStruct
- OpenStruct( or OStruct ) acts very similarly to Struct, except that it doesn't have a defined list of attributes.
To use OStruct, weneed to include the corresponding library using the "require" statement.
=end

require "ostruct"

person = OpenStruct.new
person.name = "Raj"
person.age = 56
person.salary = 500000

puts person.name


# we can also initialize an OStruct using a hash.

require "ostruct"

person1 = OpenStruct.new(name:"Raju",age:57,salary:40000)

puts person1.age
