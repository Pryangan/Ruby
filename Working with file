=begin
Creating Files
- Ruby allows us to easily create and work with files by using the built-in File class.
=end

file = File.new("test.txt","w+")

file.close


# for open an existing file we can use open method instead new method

file = File.open("test.txt","w+")


=begin
Writing Files
- The puts and write methods can be used for writing content to a file.

  The difference between the two is that puts adds a line break to the end of strings, while write does not.

  we need to close the file after performing the operations.
=end

file = File.new("test.txt","w+")
file.puts("Some text")
file.close

# Ruby can also automatically close the file.

File.open("file.txt","w+"){
    |file| file.puts("some text")
}

=begin
Reading Files
- To read the entire contents of a file the File.read method can be used.
=end

f = File.new("test.txt","w+")
f.puts("a line of text")
f.puts("another line of text")
f.close

puts File.read("text.txt")

File.open("test.txt","a+"){
    |file| file.puts("a line of text")
    file.puts("another line of text")
}

File.readlines("test.txt").each{
    |line| puts "---#{line}"
}

# we can delete a file using the File.delete method

File.delete("test.txt")

# The file? method provides an easy way of checking if the file exists

File.open("test.txt") if File.file?("text.txt")
